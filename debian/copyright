 There are such important features:
 1) Developers of Psi+ project didn't make full fork from Psi project. They are
 preparing and distributing only separate patches for the upstream (original
 Psi). Some of this patches periodicaly migrate to upstream.
 2) Psi+ developers make own plugins which incompatible with Psi.
 3) Psi+ developers make different concomitant components: themes, sounds,
 emoticon packs.
 4) There are no official tarballs for Psi+. Users should use svn/git to get
 sources.
 5) There are no even svn/git tags or preffered commits. Developing process is
 continuous.
 .
 The orig.tar.bz2 is generated from a few source trees:
 git://github.com/psi-im/psi.git
 git://github.com/psi-im/iris.git
 git://github.com/psi-im/libpsi.git
 http://psi-dev.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
 .
